##### *Is anyone going to even read this stuff, anyway?*


## New Years Resolutions
I've always found New Years resolutions a bit stupid. After all, you can resolve to do something new or set a new goal at any point in time - there's no need to wait for that third number in our date system to roll over before you can start.

That said, after a busy couple of months this happens to be the time that I have to sit down and set some goals for the future, so any resolutions I make *may as well* be New Years resolutions. Since my main goal going forward is to work harder on personal projects outside of my employment, it would be nice to have some kind of record for that work - thus, this blog.

## A Second Attempt
I actually created this site to write stuff down roughly a year and a half ago, when I did a writeup on the [the adventure of initialising OpenGL](2023-04-30-The-Pain-of-Initialising-OpenGL.md). From there I had the intention of occasionally doing more writing, with the idea of noting down anything vaguely interesting that I am working on.
The downfall in this strategy is that it requires me to actually be *working on stuff* which quickly became difficult when I got busy. At the time this proved to be too much of a challenge, and I quickly gave up on it without posting a second article, and deactivated the page.

## So, what's the point?
Before going any further with this, I think it is worth actually defining *why* I am going to start writing these blog posts again. After all, time spend doing technical writing is time that I could be spending doing literally anything else. However, there are a few reasons it is valuable:

- *Having a record of the decisions I have made* - I find that it is very easy to look at the way you have implemented stuff in the past, and forget all of the considerations that made you do it that particular way.
- *Providing awareness of the kind of stuff I like to work on* - at the time of writing, I don't really have any presence on social media, and most of my code is not publically accessible. In the chance that I apply for other jobs, *just maybe* prospective employers might be able to look here and see what I'm about.
- *Proving that I actually have worked on stuff* - it would be nice to be able to reach the end of the year and look back at my previous posts for the year and feel that I achieved *slightly more* than nothing.

While there is no guarantee that I will stick with posting this time, I'm going to *aim* to post once every two weeks, which means by the end of the year I should have roughly 25 posts. Maybe people might even occasionally read them. We'll see how it goes.
